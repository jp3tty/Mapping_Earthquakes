# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview

This is a tool to monitor earthquake information and tectonic plate fault line locations. It is designed to display earth quake locaitons over various maps types (Street, Satelitte, and Topographic). Earth quake locations are shown as circles at their given global positions. They are colored and dimensioned based off their measured magnitude. Clicking on a circle will generate a pop-up with some general information about the geological event.
